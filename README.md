## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently learning and working on some interesting robotics projects.
By integrating robotics and AI then we can potentially realize a high level of automation.
Will share progress as soon as its publicly available!

Because education is lifelong, I am to be able to collaborate in the development of projects aimed at solving some of the local and gloabl challenges.
Also aim to develop some informational courses in the future... 

#Python #C++ #MATLAB #Simulink

Stay tuned for more:-)
