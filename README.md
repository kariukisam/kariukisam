## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently learning and working on some interesting robotics projects.
By integrating robotics and AI then we can potentially realize a high level of automation.
Will share progress as soon as its publicly available!

Education and growth being a lifelong journey, I am motivated and gearing towards problem solving through design thinking and collaboration in the development of projects to tackle some of the local and global challenges.
Also aiming to develop some educational courses related to my research in the future... 

#Python #C++ #MATLAB #Simulink #Consistency

Stay tuned for more:-)
